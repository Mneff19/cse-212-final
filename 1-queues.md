# Queues
## Overview
### Purpose/Use
Queues are a simple data structure that are defined by the order in which elements are added to and removed from the structure. They are similar to stacks in this sense. In a queue, elements are added to the end of the and removed from the beginning. This is a `FIFO` structure, or `First In First Out`.

### Common example - call center

## Implementation
### Common operations
#### Add to queue
#### Remove from queue
#### Length of queue
#### Value at position
### Performance table for operations

## Examples
### Code samples - call center queue

## Common Pitfalls
### Syntax errors (very error-resistant structure)

## Sample Problem
### Restaurant order queue
