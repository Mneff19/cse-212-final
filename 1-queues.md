# Queues
## Overview
### Purpose/Use
Queues are a simple data structure that are defined by the order in which elements are added to and removed from the structure. They are similar to stacks in this sense. In a queue, elements are added to the end of the and removed from the beginning. This is known as a `FIFO` structure, or `First In First Out`, as illustrated below:

In Python, these are technically just lists but through a custom class implementation we are able to enforce this FIFO structure.

### Conceptual Example - Call Center
When you're on hold and hear the classic line "your call will be answered in the order it was received," this indicates that your call was added to a queue on the call center's servers. This is one of the most prevalent and well-known examples of a queue in our day to day lives.

## Implementation
### Common operations
#### Add to queue
#### Remove from queue
#### Length of queue
#### Value at position
### Performance table for operations

## Examples
### Code samples - call center queue

## Common Pitfalls
### Syntax errors (very error-resistant structure)

## Sample Problem
### Restaurant order queue
